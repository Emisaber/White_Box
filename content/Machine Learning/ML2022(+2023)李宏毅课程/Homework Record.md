## Homework 1
- DNN for regression
- Tips:  hyper-paremeter tuning, feature selection, regularization.....   

#### Dataset
COVID-19 CMU收集的数据集，一些状态和最终为阳性的数据  
- state 37
- tested positive 1

区分州  --- one-hot  

#### Metric
MSE  

#### TODO
- [ ] modify model's structure, be aware of dimensions.
- [ ] Select suitable feature columns.
- [x] Please check https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html to get more available algorithms.
- [x] L2 regularization (optimizer(weight decay...) or implement by your self).

#### I did
[[L1 &L2]] in Torch
